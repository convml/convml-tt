  `TripletTrainerModel.load_from_checkpoint`
  [\#46](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/46)

*changed default*

  [\#44](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/44)


## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.9.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0)

*new features*

- Add before and after training logger for producing a dendrogram plot
  [\#40](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/40)

- Add "best triplet" option to tile sampling method for dendrogram plot
  which uses triplets for which anchor-neighbor are the closest
  [\#38](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/38)

- Add rectpred sample plot function [\#30](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/30)

- Enable dendrogram plots for triplets [\#35](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/35)

- Add interactive rect plot for visualising embedding distance to
  a selected part of the domain [\#34](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/34)

- Add one-cycle learning rate scheduler
  [\#32](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/32)

*changed default*

- Weight decay (L2-regularisation) is now enabled by default (set to
  `0.01`) and the learning-rate has been increased to `1.0e-2` to match
  the values used when training the fastai v1 based model. Note this
  learning-rate was optimised for for a batch-size of `50` using the
  `resnet18` architecture. For different batch-size, weight-decay or
  architecture a new learning may be needed (use the [pytorch lightning
  learning rate
  finder](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/lr_finder.html))
  [\#30](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/30)

*bugfixes*

- Fix for grid-overview plot always showing same set of tiles rather than tiles with indecies provided [\#36](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/36)

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.7.0)

Model architecture and training rewritten to use [pytorch-lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/).

Specifically this includes:

- `pytorch.Dataset` (`convml_tt.data.TripletDataset`) for handling loading of individual triplet datasets (and one for single-tile datasets). This has the option to load all data into a single numpy memory-mapped array to reduce number of disc reads

- `pytorch_lightning.LightningDataModule` (`convml_tt.data.TripletDataModule`) for handling transform, batching and splitting data for train/test
  
  - includes transforms previously provided by fastai now using the
    [kornia](https://kornia.github.io/) library
  - correct normalisation when using pretrained network is used

- `pytorch_lightning.LightningModule` (`convml_tt.system.TripletTrainerModel`) which handles the training logic: building model, setting learning rate, batch size. This is now flexible in the number of embedding dimensions used

- Command-line interface for doing training (`convml_tt.trainer`)

- functionality for downloading and unpacking example datasets

- refactoring of utility functions and inference plots to ensure they work with
  the new architecture

- ARC3 HPC and JASMIN HPC systems submission scripts (SGE and SLURM) for running training on single GPU
