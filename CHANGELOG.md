# Changelog

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.12.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0)

*new features*

- Add option for reduced precision training (16bit) which enables training on
  hardware with less memory available
  [\#62](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/62)

- Add new isomap 2D embedding manifold plot which takes the best (nearest
  anchor-neighbor) triplets and plots these at a uniform sampling across an
  isomap 2D extracted embedding manifold
  [\#57](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/57)

- annotated scatterplot now uses matplotlib's AnnotationBbox which means that
  annotated scatterplots can be rescaled (with say `ax.set_xlim`) with
  annotations staying in place and keep a fixed size
  [\#58](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/59)

*bugfixes*

- Fix bug in dendrogram plot where wrong tiles were shown when creating a
  dendrogram from a data-array of embedding vectors that have been filtered (so
  that the tile ids don't just from 0, 1, 2 etc)
  [\#67](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/67)

*general improvements*

- Option to skip tile triplets with missing tiles when creating `TripletDataset`
  [\#64](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/64)

*maintenance*

- Ensure loading of fastai v1 models (from weights) also works when we have a
  GPU available
  [\#68](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/68)

- Add CI action to automatically publish tagged releases on pypi
  [\#63](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/63)

- Move all tile and cartesian regridded data generation to a separate package
  [convml-data](https://github.com/convml/convml-data)
  [\#56](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/56)

- Fix CI testing by switching to microconda and unpinning pytorch version
  (since kornia now supports pytorch==1.8.0) and switch to pre-commit for
  linting while fixing linting issues picked up during this switch.
  [\#60](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/60)

- Move examples downloading functionality into package instead of relying on
  torchvision since the code in there keeps changing and breaking our examples
  [\#61](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/61)

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.11.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.10.1...v0.11.0)

*new features*

- Annotated scatterplots now work for `data.dataset.MovingWindowImageTilingDataset`s
  [\#52](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/52)

- `utils.get_embeddings` now uses GPU for producing the embeddings if one is
  available, drastically speeding up inference time.
  [\#53](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/53)

*breaking changes*

- `utils.make_sliding_tile_model_predictions` has been removed in favour of
  using `utils.get_embeddings` directly
  [\#54](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/54)


## [v0.10.1](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.10.1)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1)

*bugfixes*

- Fix for xarray bug which arised with call in
  `utils.interpretation.rectpred.plot.make_rgb`
  [\#51](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/51)


## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.10.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0)

*new features*

- Add writer for tensorboard projector visualizer to enable exploration of
  tiles in embedding space
  [\#43](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/43)

- support for z-order and zero-offset annotations in annotated scatterplot
  [\#44](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/44)

- add isomap to available transforms on rectangular domain
  [\#47](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/47)

- make it possible to load fastai v1 model using
  `TripletTrainerModel.load_from_checkpoint`
  [\#46](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/46)

- add `data.dataset.MovingWindowImageTilingDataset` to produce image tile
  data from a sliding window across a larger image
  [\#45](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/45)

*breaking changes*

- `utils.make_sliding_tile_model_predictions` now takes in
  a `data.dataset.MovingWindowImageTilingDataset` rather than an image,
  and so a dataset must be created from an image first
  [\#45](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/45)

*changed default*

- annotated scatterplot now sets equal x/y-axis
  [\#44](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/44)

*maintenance*

- fix for `pytorch-ligtning >= 1.5.0` and exclude `torchvision == 0.10.*`
  (can't load `.tgz` files)
  [\#48](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/48)

- Add link to Google Colab instructions
  [\#48](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/49)



## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.9.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0)

*new features*

- Add before and after training logger for producing a dendrogram plot
  [\#40](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/40)

- Add "best triplet" option to tile sampling method for dendrogram plot
  which uses triplets for which anchor-neighbor are the closest
  [\#38](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/38)

- Add rectpred sample plot function [\#30](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/30)

- Enable dendrogram plots for triplets [\#35](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/35)

- Add interactive rect plot for visualising embedding distance to
  a selected part of the domain [\#34](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/34)

- Add one-cycle learning rate scheduler
  [\#32](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/32)

*changed default*

- Weight decay (L2-regularisation) is now enabled by default (set to
  `0.01`) and the learning-rate has been increased to `1.0e-2` to match
  the values used when training the fastai v1 based model. Note this
  learning-rate was optimised for for a batch-size of `50` using the
  `resnet18` architecture. For different batch-size, weight-decay or
  architecture a new learning may be needed (use the [pytorch lightning
  learning rate
  finder](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/lr_finder.html))
  [\#30](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/30)

*bugfixes*

- Fix for grid-overview plot always showing same set of tiles rather than tiles with indecies provided [\#36](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/pull/36)

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/convml/convml_tt/tree/v0.7.0)

Model architecture and training rewritten to use [pytorch-lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/).

Specifically this includes:

- `pytorch.Dataset` (`convml_tt.data.TripletDataset`) for handling loading of individual triplet datasets (and one for single-tile datasets). This has the option to load all data into a single numpy memory-mapped array to reduce number of disc reads

- `pytorch_lightning.LightningDataModule` (`convml_tt.data.TripletDataModule`) for handling transform, batching and splitting data for train/test

  - includes transforms previously provided by fastai now using the
    [kornia](https://kornia.github.io/) library
  - correct normalisation when using pretrained network is used

- `pytorch_lightning.LightningModule` (`convml_tt.system.TripletTrainerModel`) which handles the training logic: building model, setting learning rate, batch size. This is now flexible in the number of embedding dimensions used

- Command-line interface for doing training (`convml_tt.trainer`)

- functionality for downloading and unpacking example datasets

- refactoring of utility functions and inference plots to ensure they work with
  the new architecture

- ARC3 HPC and JASMIN HPC systems submission scripts (SGE and SLURM) for running training on single GPU
